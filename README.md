*You should be able to figure it out pretty fast. You're a tank in a pit of abandoned Christmas crap. Are those rocks? Are they coal? Doesn't matter: everyone is naughty in the pit, and the Snowmen are about to judge you harder than an anonymous teenager on the internet.*

Bucking the theme, I wanted to create a tank battle game inspired by the original 'Battle Zone' arcade game.

It started out that way, and got...christmassy early on.

This is the post-jam version. I added GameJolt integration, and some features (like an overhead radar) based on player feedback.

Plenty of bugs left: snowmen vanish and get confused. You can flip yourself somewhat easily, if you're determined.

I'll spend the next day or two finishing up. Lots of ideas not added to hit the Jam deadline that will make this a bit more fun: planned for the tank to hold a limited supply of snowballs, and be able to reload from supplies that will spawn around the map. And more.
